Hyper Island - If this then that

### :open_file_folder: The Brief:

Group project to incorporate the project management tools we've been learning (github, agile, kanban/scrum) to create a web project that incorporates the javascriot date function as well as local or session storage.


### :hourglass_flowing_sand: Time spent / Deadline:

2 weeks

### :dart: Goals:

Even if it was a group project, I went with a personal recipe bank and set the following goals:
- Learn more HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Create the random appearing rabbit
- Build the difficulty page
- Explore more JS
- Learn teamqwork
- Using github in group

### :grimacing: Description:

The White Rabbit is an interactive reaction speed game, themed around The Matrix, similar in style to other simple games that are often created for use as marketing materials as part of a larger advertising campaign. The game prompts the user to click on a series of small rabbit images that appear in random positions on the screen as fast as they can. At the end of the game, the user will receive a final time (factoring in penalties for misclicking or missing rabbits), as well as an average reaction time along with other statistics from the game. A gif of a Matrix character will also be displayed, depending on the user's final time. Stats are then saved into the local stroage for use in the highscore page, which displays the user's ten best times.

### :blue_book: Learnings:

- HTML / CSS / JS
- Functions:
  Used JS Date function to track both the appearance and clicked on time of each rabbit to give an accurate reaction speed.
  Used JS Date function to calculate a total time for each game session, factoring in time penalties.
  Used local storage to save the user's time and a variety of statsafter each session. 
  Function to retrieve stats from local storage, sort them, and display them on the highscore page.
  Function that generates random coordinates to display each rabbit.
  A function to randomise the time between rabbit appearances.
  Functions to track misclicks and missed rabbits which are factored into the final time as penalties.
  A variable difficulty system that decreased the time the rabbit was on screen as the difficulty rose.

- Responsiveness:
  Media query on the landing page to allow for functionality at any ratio.
  Decent responsiveness across other pages to allow for full function down to around tablet screen size.
  Variable coordinates in the game function to allow for full function at any screen ratio.

- Style/Animation:
  Inclusion of a fullscreen background video.
  Simple styling animations on buttons and logos.
  A function that displays various text and character gifs based on user's final time.
  Inclusion of a custom favicon.

- Workflow:
  Used GitHub with all team members working in a new branch for each major feature and making frequent commits and merges.
  Planning the project in a Kanban style Trello board.
  All styling done in SCSS.
